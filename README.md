# Abbreviation_generator
This repository contains a python program that can be used to generate abbreviations
The Denu_Main_Abbrev.py file contains the implementation of the procedure for generating the code whereas the Denu_Preprocessing.py contain functions that help 
to make the processes possible: Like reading a text file and cleaning it, applying some rules and scores to each possible abbreviation and selecting the one
with the least scores.
The functions in the Denu_Preprocessing.py file are imported into the Denu_Main_Abbrev.py file to compute the process.
